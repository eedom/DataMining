# DataMining

Introduction to Data Mining class projects  

Introduction to data mining course, a discipline whose overall goal is to obtain knowledge through the systematic search for patterns and relationships in rather large and potentially unstructured data. The huge amounts of data generated today are too large and complex to be processed and analyzed by traditional methods. This course aims to discuss frameworks and algorithms that can be used to transform raw data into useful information for decision making.
